🍷 Red Wine Quality - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project explores the Red Wine Quality dataset, which contains physicochemical test results (e.g., acidity, chlorides, sulphates, alcohol) and corresponding quality ratings (0–10).

The objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify relationships between features and understand how they impact wine quality.

📊 Steps in Analysis

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Checked for null values and data types

Verified dataset structure

Univariate Analysis

Histograms for feature distributions

Bar plots for wine quality counts

Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

Heatmap → Correlation between features

Scatterplots & Pairplots → Relationship across variables

Catplots → Category-wise comparison of wine quality

🔎 Key Insights

Alcohol, sulphates, and citric acid are positively correlated with wine quality.

Density and volatile acidity show negative correlation with quality.

Most wines are rated between 5 and 6, showing a skewed distribution of quality scores.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Seaborn, Matplotlib
